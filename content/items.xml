<!--
 Note: there is several type of items, the type is the name of the
 entry (<passive.../> defines a passive type item).
 - Those are: passive, active, familiar and trinket

 - use the fields `bombs`, `coins` and `keys` to control how many
   consumables your item gives when you pick it up. For exemple
   `bombs="10" keys="10"` gives the player 10 keys and 10 bombs when
   the item is picked up.

 Note: all heart counts are calculated in half hearts.
 - `maxhearts` is the number of heart containers to add.
 - `hearts` is count of red hearts to add, it won't exceed the amount of
   heart containers the player have.
 - `soulhearts` is the number of spirit hearts to add.
 - `blackhearts` the number of black hearts to add.

 Note: Red Candle has a `maxcharges` value of 110
 - For active items `maxcharges` control the number of charges the item have
   A value of `maxcharge="0"` means infinite charges.

 - `cooldown` is the number of frames you want the player to freez after
   using the item

 Note on making stat modifying items: the mod needs to have a
 MC_EVALUATE_CACHE callback in main.lua in order to catch the
 modification and apply the actual stat changes.
 - `cache` are the flags to set when calling functions callbacks to
   MC_EVALUATE_CACHE. They are a space separated list of stat names,
   the possible values are as following:
     `speed`, `range`, `shotspeed`, `damage`, `tearcolor`, `tearflag`,
     `firedelay`, `luck`, `flying` and `all`
   All the flags might not work, but some work. If you want to call
   MC_EVALUATE_CACHE with the damage, luck and speed flags, put
   `cache="damage luck speed"` in your item xml definiton.

 - `special` if you want your item to be special, because it's special
   a special item has special set to `special="true"`

 - `devilprice` the number of red heart containers your item should cost in
   a devil room (`devilprice="1"` or `devilprice="2"`)
